# In Python, every object has a unique identifier that can be accessed 
# using the id() function. This function returns the identity of an object,
# which is guaranteed to be unique for the object's lifetime. 
# For certain basic immutable data types like short strings or integers, 
# Python might reuse the memory address for objects with the same value. 
# This is known as "interning".

# Given the following code, predict the output:
a = 42
b = 42
c = a

print(id(a) == id(b) == id(c))

# True. because they all reference the same object in memory
