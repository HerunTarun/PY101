Which user and group are assigned to the $HOME folder?


$HOME is a variable assigned to, in my case, the path /home/ec2-user

so you're really asking about the user and group assigned to ec2-user

that can be found using ls -l /home

ec2-user has a ec2-user assigned as a user, and ec2-user assigned as group
